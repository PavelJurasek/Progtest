Create a program that for a given password checks whether it meets the following requirements:

 - the length is at least 5 characters,
 - it contains at least one upper case or lower case letter,
 - it contains at least one number,
 - it contains at least one character that is not a number or a letter.
 
The input of the program is a single-worded string (a string does not contain spaces, line ends or any other white characters).

The output of the program is the information whether or not the password meets the requirements. The output is always concluded with a newline.

**Sample instances of the problem:**

abcdefgh123451#$@@#!
The password meets the requirements.

1a2a3a%a^
The password meets the requirements.

abcedfed
The password does not meet the requirements.

a1@#

abce212
