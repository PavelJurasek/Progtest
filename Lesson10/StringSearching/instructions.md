Implement a program, which will compute and display, if there is a substring in the enter string. Moreover, if there is, the program lists all positions in the string where the searched string was found. Secondly, it should count the number of given character.

The program's input are three strings - original, substring and the character.

The program's output is this information:

- if the string contains the substring,
- the list of positions where the substring was found,
- the number of character's occurrence.

The program shall search the substring case-insensitive. On the contrary, the character occurrences shall be counted with respect to the character upper/lower case. The input strings do not execeed 100 characters in length.

**The program's work demonstration:**

Enter a string, a substring, and a character:
writingstringfunctionsforfarstrings str s
String 'str' found, position(s): 7, 28
Character 's' found 4 times.

Enter a string, a substring, and a character:
AsDiscussedIntheChapter section d
Substring 'section' not found.
Character 'd' found 1 times.

Enter a string, a substring, and a character:
TheyseekHIMheretheySEEKhimthere ThEy h
String 'ThEy' found, position(s): 0, 15
Character 'h' found 5 times.

Enter a string, a substring, and a character:
AaaaaaaaAAAAaaaaAAAaaAAA aaaa A
String 'aaaa' found, position(s): 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20
Character 'A' found 11 times.

Enter a string, a substring, and a character:
sluncesenojahodysluncesenoaparfacekslunceseno seno S
String 'seno' found, position(s): 6, 22, 41
Character 'S' found 0 times.

Enter a string, a substring, and a character:
string missing
Invalid input.
