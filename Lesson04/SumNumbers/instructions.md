Your task is to develop a program that sums decimal numbers from the input. The will read decimal numbers until it reads number 1000. It then displays the sum.

The input is a sequence of decimal numbers terminated by number 1000.

The output of the program is the sum of the input numbers, the sum shall include the terminating number 1000. Do not forget newline (\n).

The program shall detect erroneous input. If there is an ill-formatted number in the input, the program shall display error message (see below) and terminate. The error message shall be sent to the standard output (not to the standard error output).

**Sample program output:**

Enter the numbers:
10.5
358
687.5
1000
The sum is: 2056.000000

Enter the numbers:
1236.7
5698
3578
12.56
356.59
10
1000
The sum is: 11891.850000

Enter the numbers:
1
2.5
3.987
1000
The sum is: 1007.487000

Enter the numbers:
abcd
Invalid input.

**Advice:**

- Use double data type to represent the numbers. Do not use float data type.
